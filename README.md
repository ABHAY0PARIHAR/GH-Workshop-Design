# GH-Workshop-Design

This is a repo for submissions of tasks that are assigned under workshops carried by the Design wing for the Aparoska 2021 technical months.


### How to submit entries

Pretty simple!
Just enter the required task directory for the day, which are quite understandable by the name itself.
For eg. For tasks assigned under Day 1- could be found under the 'Day1' directory and under that a bunch of directories mentioning the task assigned.
